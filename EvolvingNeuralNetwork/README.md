# EvolvingNeuralNetwork
This project contains a simple implementation of evolving neural networks through random mutations in c#. 
I put together an evolution simulator where birds use the neural network to learn to fly through an obstacle course. 
Feel free to use this Unity project for your own fun. Check it out on Youtube:

# Assets
I downloaded the game background from https://opengameart.org/content/game-background-forest, it is published under the CC0 license. 
All other scripts and assets I created myself. I appreciate if you credit me and I'm interested to see your projects if this one inspired you.

# Work in progress
I will develop this project further and maybe I will do a tutorial. Just let me know if you have questions or suggestions.
